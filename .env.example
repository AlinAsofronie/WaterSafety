# ============================================
# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT MODE (No AWS required)
# ============================================
# Set to "true" to run entirely locally without AWS services
# - Uses in-memory storage instead of DynamoDB
# - Bypasses AWS Cognito authentication
# - Mocks email sending instead of using SES
#
# This is the recommended setup for local development!

# ============================================
# AWS Configuration (Only needed for production or AWS testing)
# ============================================
# To connect to real AWS services, set USE_LOCAL_STORAGE=false

# - User Pool ID: eu-west-2_uZhfIxAA7
# - User Pool Client ID: 24a2n8fjsq4tvrtfdgtqkp71fl
# - Region: eu-west-2
